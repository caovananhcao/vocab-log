🔍 How This Differs from Flashcard Apps

Unlike traditional flashcard tools (e.g., apps focused only on spaced repetition), Vocab Log combines structured note-taking with lightweight review:

Emphasizes learning sessions rather than isolated word cards

Encourages reflection through mood and time-spent tracking

Supports context-rich entries (example sentences and notes)

Includes self-assessed mastery instead of only algorithm-driven review

Designed for classroom-friendly use, not just intensive solo memorization

Vocab Log sits between a vocabulary notebook and a flashcard system, aiming to support both recording and meaningful review.
